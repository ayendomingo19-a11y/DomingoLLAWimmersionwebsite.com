      <div class="w3-container w3-teal">
        <h3>Day 1 (11/17/2025)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-padding entry-content">
        <p><b>I. Accomplishments & Skills:</b><br>
        Today I reported to mam Alona A. Pioquinto early in the morning to ask if I could be assigned to elementary. However, we were told to wait for our assigned teacher. Today I was assigned to check various test papers from different subjects in Grade 11 and 12, record their scores, and perform frequency of error.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. Difficulties:</b><br>
        The task that I found difficult to accomplish today was the frequency of error since there are few checkers and a lot of test papers were assigned to be same person. We employed new strategies of saying how many were right and wrong in a group, individual tallying, or noting multiple number at once.</p>
        
        <p><b>III. School vs Reality:</b><br>
        All of the tasks were taught in school since it was just checking of exam and frequency of error.</p>
        
        <p><b>IV. General Insight:</b><br>
        There is sometimes times when I get rushed and I realize in tasks like these being patient is better. We also have to be careful and double check all of the scores and names being written since someone's grades are in our hands.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Day 2 (11/18/2025) -->
    <div class="w3-white w3-card w3-padding-large entry-card">
      <div class="w3-container w3-teal">
        <h3>Day 2 (11/18/2025)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-padding entry-content">
        <p><b>I. Accomplishments & Skills:</b><br>
        Today I did the same thing as yesterday however it was harder since there were way more test papers to check. Luckily our numbers also increased since Atom, Law, and Pounds were all working together. Today I also took it upon myself to do the frequency of error in EAPP all by myelf sas my other classmates were busy. We also had to figure out who's test papers are those with no names, and clarification to specific subject's answer sheets.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. Difficulties:</b><br>
        The specific tasks we encountered that were a bit difficult was coordinating with other sections since some checked and some did frequency of error. Some wanted to check their own scores and some test papers were blown by the wind and we had to find them.</p>
        
        <p><b>III. School vs Reality:</b><br>
        All of the tasks I encountered are taught in school and I did them all pretty well.</p>
        
        <p><b>IV. General Insight:</b><br>
        We must learn to organize and divide the tasks well in order to improve efficiency. It improved me as a person as I executed these well and gained more experience.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Day 3 (11/19/2025) -->
    <div class="w3-white w3-card w3-padding-large entry-card">
      <div class="w3-container w3-teal">
        <h3>Day 3 (11/19/2025) </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-padding entry-content">
        <p><b>I. Accomplishments & Skills:</b><br>
        Today I finally got assigned to the teacher which I will be assisting, and it's ma'am Crischel Lyn Abayon! Today I learned how to use and scan google sheets with patience as I have to encode various activities and performance tasks for their Grade 11 Subject, Philosophy. I also had to network to my friends in Grade 11 to receive their full master list as some names were not accurate.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. Difficulties:</b><br>
        It is hard to scan for scores and names as it is very tedious especially if a sheet is unorganized so you will have to organize it first.</p>
        
        <p><b>III. School vs Reality:</b><br>
        This task was not taught in school as you need to have technology and media literacy in using apps such as sheets, docs, word, and excel.</p>
        
        <p><b>IV. General Insight:</b><br>
        It is also important to rest and relax your eyes especially after looking at scores for the whole day as you might encode it wrong and that is a huge responsibility.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Day 4 (11/21/2025) -->
    <div class="w3-white w3-card w3-padding-large entry-card">
      <div class="w3-container w3-teal">
        <h3>Day 4 (11/21/2025)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-padding entry-content">
        <p><b>I. Accomplishments & Skills:</b><br>
        Today I continued encoding scores again as it was several pages of scores. Double checking frequently. It was also today that I started tracking who's names were not there or who didn't have scores in particular activities, reportings, and performance tasks. I also recorded Grade 12- lows periodical TNCT exam.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. Difficulties:</b><br>
        I didn't really find any task difficult today as I have been getting used to it. Your laptop's RAM capacity is also very important as you need to remember to minimize tabs.</p>
        
        <p><b>III. School vs Reality:</b><br>
        All of the tasks today are encountered in school.</p>
        
        <p><b>IV. General Insight:</b><br>
        It is very important to double check when encoding data and to label them properly in order not to get lost.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Day 5 (11/23/2025) -->
    <div class="w3-white w3-card w3-padding-large entry-card">
      <div class="w3-container w3-teal">
        <h3>Day 5 (11/23/2025)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-padding entry-content">
        <p><b>I. Accomplishments & Skills:</b><br>
        Today I organized notebooks, transferred a messy spreadsheet of grades to paper, and helped other STEC- immersionists with their tasks. Transferring the digital spreadsheet took a really long time as it is hard to read. I decided to tackle it in chunks and divide the columns as well as fix the names. I did feel under the weather today so I took meaningful breaks, wore a jacket inside the room, and ate a lot of food.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. Difficulties:</b><br>
        Again the spreadsheets were really hard to read and it was difficult to track everyone's scores especially if they are blank or not centered.</p>

        <p><b>III. School vs Reality:</b><br>
        The initial skills (organizing, transferring data) are school-taught, but handling the sheer volume and condition of unorganized real-world data is a new challenge in immersion.</p>
        
        <p><b>IV. General Insight:</b><br>
        Taking care of your health, like taking meaningful breaks when under the weather, is crucial for maintaining focus and accuracy, especially when handling important data.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Day 6 (11/29/2025) -->
    <div class="w3-white w3-card w3-padding-large entry-card">
      <div class="w3-container w3-teal">
        <h3>Day 6 (11/29/2025)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-padding entry-content">
        <p><b>I. Accomplishments & Skills:</b><br>
        Today we cleaned the classroom thoroughly and I also reported to ma'am Abayon multiple times today. I was compiling my immersion documents and photos to ensure that they are complete and in the right order. Since there was not much ma'am assigned me today I decided to compile all my documents in applying for the DOST scholarship and scouting out the requirements for other schools as well.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. Difficulties:</b><br>
        I didn't really find any specific task I found difficult today as I am used to these tasks in school.</p>

        <p><b>III. School vs Reality:</b><br>
        All of the tasks I encountered are taught in school (organization, research, cleaning).</p>
        
        <p><b>IV. General Insight:</b><br>
        Today I realized how important it is to utilize "free time" in order to ensure that future tasks would be more efficient. Being proactive pays off.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Day 7 (11/30/2025) - Collecting Outputs -->
    <div class="w3-white w3-card w3-padding-large entry-card">
      <div class="w3-container w3-teal">
        <h3>Day 7 (11/30/2025) - Collecting Outputs</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-padding entry-content">
        <p><b>I. Accomplishments & Skills:</b><br>
        Today, I focused on collecting and organizing outputs from different classes. I made sure every document was in its correct folder and double-checked each sheet for accuracy. I also created a checklist to keep track of which students’ papers were missing or incomplete. I found satisfaction in seeing the work neatly arranged.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. Difficulties:</b><br>
        The tricky part was locating misplaced documents and clarifying with classmates whose papers were missing. Some students hadn’t written their names correctly, and I had to carefully match their papers to their names.</p>
        
        <p><b>III. School vs Reality:</b><br>
        Part of this is something we do in school, organizing materials and checking lists, but managing such a large volume of work in a real classroom setting is entirely new. I had to be meticulous and proactive.</p>
        
        <p><b>IV. General Insight:</b><br>
        I learned that being proactive and detail-oriented saves time and prevents problems later. I also recognized the importance of taking initiative and helping others.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Day 8 (12/01/2025) - Document Prep -->
    <div class="w3-white w3-card w3-padding-large entry-card">
      <div class="w3-container w3-teal">
        <h3>Day 8 (12/01/2025) - Document Prep</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-padding entry-content">
        <p><b>I. Accomplishments & Skills:</b><br>
        Today, I helped prepare all necessary documents for the immersion program. I formatted masterlists, checked the files for accuracy, and compiled them in order. I also assisted teachers in preparing handouts for students. I realized that preparation is key to efficiency.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. Difficulties:</b><br>
        Some files were messy or incomplete, and I had to coordinate with classmates and teachers to clarify the details. It was a bit stressful to ensure that everything was correct, but I took it as a challenge to improve my accuracy and attention to detail.</p>
        
        <p><b>III. School vs Reality:</b><br>
        Document preparation and organization is partly taught in school, but the responsibility and scale in a real immersion setting is new. I had to apply problem-solving, coordination, and technical skills.</p>
        
        <p><b>IV. General Insight:</b><br>
        I realized that efficiency and attention to detail go hand in hand. I also learned that teamwork and communication are crucial; when we support each other, tasks that seem overwhelming become manageable.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Day 9 (12/02/2025) - Layouting -->
    <div class="w3-white w3-card w3-padding-large entry-card">
      <div class="w3-container w3-teal">
        <h3>Day 9 (12/02/2025) - Layouting</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-padding entry-content">
        <p><b>I. Accomplishments & Skills:</b><br>
        Today was a fun and creative day! I worked on graphic design and perfecting the layout of our program, using Canva and other tools to make it visually appealing. I adjusted colors, fonts, and spacing to ensure the program looked professional and engaging. I also collaborated with other immersionists, giving and receiving feedback to refine our work.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. Difficulties:</b><br>
        Balancing creativity with accuracy was challenging. I had to make sure that the layout was not only beautiful but also readable and correct. Some elements required multiple revisions, which tested my patience.</p>
        
        <p><b>III. School vs Reality:</b><br>
        Graphic design and layouting are skills that we explore in school, but applying them to a real-life immersion program with deadlines and collaboration is new. I had to combine creativity, technical skills, and teamwork to succeed.</p>
        
        <p><b>IV. General Insight:</b><br>
        I learned that creativity can enhance organization and efficiency when used thoughtfully. Seeing our hard work materialize in a polished program reinforced the importance of attention to detail, perseverance, and collaboration.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Day 10 (12/03/2025) - Final Reflections -->
    <div class="w3-white w3-card w3-padding-large entry-card">
      <div class="w3-container w3-teal">
        <h3>Day 10 (12/03/2025) - Final Reflections</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-padding entry-content">
        <p><b>I. Accomplishments & Skills:</b><br>
        Today was the culmination of our immersion, the program itself! I was one of the student speakers, which was nerve-wracking but exciting. I confidently skirted the table while presenting, helping with logistics, preparing food, and even buying gifts for our adviser to show appreciation. I felt a deep sense of pride seeing our preparation pay off.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. Difficulties:</b><br>
        Coordinating multiple responsibilities at the same time, speaking, assisting, and helping prepare the food, was challenging. I had to be aware of timing, multitask efficiently, and remain calm under pressure.</p>
        
        <p><b>III. School vs Reality:</b><br>
        Many of the tasks, like speaking in public and event coordination, are not something we are explicitly taught in school. These real-world experiences strengthened skills like confidence, multitasking, and interpersonal communication.</p>
        
        <p><b>IV. General Insight:</b><br>
        I learned that preparation, creativity, and teamwork are the backbone of a successful program. I also realized how much I’ve grown during the immersion — patience, organization, leadership, and empathy have all improved.</p>
