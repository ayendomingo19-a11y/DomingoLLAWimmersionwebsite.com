        <p><b>I. Accomplishments & Skills:</b><br>
        Today I reported to ma;am Alona A. Pioquito early in the morning to ask if I could be assigned to elementary. However, ma'am told me that we will be assigned to senior high, and we were told to wait for our assigned teacher. Today I was assigned to check various test papers from different subjects in Grade 11 and 12, record their scores, and perform frequency of error.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. Difficulties:</b><br>
        The task that I found difficult to accomplish today was the frequency of error since there are few checkers and a lot of test papers were assigned to be same person. We employ a new strategy of saying how many were right and wrong in group, tallying, or noting multiple numbers at once.</p>
        
        <p><b>III. School vs Reality:</b><br>
        All of the tasks were taught in school since it was just checking of exams and frequency of error.</p>
        
        <p><b>IV. General Insight:</b><br>
        There is sometimes times when I get rushed and gain being patient is better. We also have to be careful and double check all of the scores and names being written since someone's grades are in our hands.</p>

        <h3>Day 2 (11/18/2025)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-padding entry-content">
        <p><b>I. Accomplishments & Skills:</b><br>
        Today I did the same thing as yesterday however it was harder since there were way more test papers to check. Luckily our numbers also increased since Atom, Low, and Pounds were all working together. Today I also took it upon myself to do the frequency of error in EAPP all by myself as my other classmates were busy. We also had to figure out who's test papers are those with no names, and clarification to specific subject's answer sheets.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. Difficulties:</b><br>
        The specific tasks we encountered that were a bit difficult was coordinating with other sections since some checked and some did frequency of error. Some wanted to check their own scores and some test papers were blown by the wind and we had to find them.</p>
        
        <p><b>III. School vs Reality:</b><br>
        All of the tasks I encountered are taught in school and I did them all pretty well.</p>
        
        <p><b>IV. General Insight:</b><br>
        We must learn to organize and divide the tasks well in order to improve efficiency. It improved me as a person as I executed these well and gained more experience.</p>
